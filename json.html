    <p>

    JSON stringify, and parse are used to turn an object, and arrays into a strings, and then reparse those strings back into<br>
    an object, or array. This is mainly used as a way to move objects, and strings around to things like web servers, databases, <br>
    and through API.<br>
    <br>
    Say we have an object that we have created like <xmp>var obj = { "name":"John", "age":30, "city":"New York"};</xmp> <br>
    We can then turn that object into a string by using this syntax. <xmp>var myJSON = JSON.stringify(obj);</xmp><br>
    This is the output.<br>
        <a id="string"></a>
        <br><br>

    JSON Parse is the reverse of strinigy. Once you have turned your object, or array into a string, and passed it to where you<br>
    want it to be, you can change it back into an object by using parse. So say we now take this string, and pass it back through<br>
    parse like this <xmp>
        var obj1 = JSON.parse('{name":"John", "age":30, "city":"New York"}');
        document.getElementById("parse").innerHTML = obj1.name + ", " obj1.age;
        </xmp><br>
        The object should be able to pass name and age now.
        <a id="parse"></a>
