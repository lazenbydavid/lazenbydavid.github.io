    <h2>HTML Tags</h2><br>

    <p>
    The basic syntax for a tag would be...<br>
    <xmp><video,audio src="filename"></video,audio></xmp><br>
    You can also add quite a few controls through HTML like height, width, etc by adding the parameters after the file name.<br>
    There is also the autoplay fearure that can be added. In most cases this is just a really obnoxius way to force the content<br>
    on the end user as by itself it removes controls. If you really want to irritate the end user you can add the loop feature<br>
    as well.<br>
    There are times when these features are usefull, for example in the video on this page I set it to autoplay on a loop, but<br>
    this video has no sound, and is not very distracting. you can also add a conrols feature to allow end users to pause features<br>
    I have also added this feature to this video.<br><br>

    This is the line for this short video <xmp><video src="Toy_3.mp4" width="800" height="800" autoplay loop controls></video></xmp>


        <!--this will play the mp4 of the snowglobe on a loop-->
        <video src="Toy_3.mp4" width="800" height="800" autoplay loop controls></video>

    </p><br>

    <p>

    Canvas is a little bit different from other HTML tags. Canvas allows the use of JavaScript in a window for many different applications.<br>
    You can create mini games, animations, or pictures, as well as other things in JavaScript and then pull them into the HTML canvas window<br>
    Instead of using source="filename" you would use id="objectname" Other than that the syntax is the same.<br>

    <!-- Put this at the bottom of your "body" tag. It will load the file "script.js" and run your javascript -->
    <script src="./scripts.js">
