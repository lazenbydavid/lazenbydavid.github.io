    <p>Loops, conditional statments, Functions, Variables, Parameter, Arrays,<br> Associative Arrays</p>



    <h2>Loops</h2>

    <p>Loops are handy if you need to run a piece of code over and over again. This can be used for a counting function,<br>
    or to display something like a inventory, or many other uses. The most common is the for statement.<br>
        If I were to write<br></p>
   <!-- <xmp>
    var text = "";
        var i;
        for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            text += "the number is " + i + "<br>";
        }
             document.getElementById("counting").innerHTML = text;
    </xmp>-->
        <br>
    <p>Then it would produce a counter like this.<br></p>
    <a id="counting"></a><br>
    <br><br>
    <h2>Conditional Statements</h2>

    <p>
    Conditional statements set up a list of conditions that if met will execute the command for that line. They<br>
    start with an "if", and can run through more condtions with "else if". It is good practice to finish a conditional<br>
    statement with a final "else" statement with no condtion to be met, this can output an error message or code<br>
    letting the user know that none of the condtions were met.<br>
    an example of this will be on the next section for functions.
        <br><br></p>
    <h2>Functions & Prameters</h2>

    <p>
    A function is a block of code that performs a task when called. You will want to make a function when you want<br>
    to reuse code multiple times. You can use many different types of script in your functions to produce the results<br>
    you are looking for. The ifelse statements here would be the parameters.<br>
    So if I create this function using a conditional statement to greet users, it would look like this.<br></p>
    <xmp>
    function greetfunct() {
            var txt;
            var person = prompt("Who are you?");
            if (person == "Bob"){
                txt = "Hello " + person + " lets get started.";
            }
            else if (person == "Mary") {
                txt = "Hello " + person + " lets get started.";
            }
            else () {
                txt = "I don't talk to strangers"
            }
            document.getElementById("greet").innerHTML = txt;
        }
    </xmp>

    <p>Here is the output.</p>
    <button onclick="greetfunct()">Who are you</button>
    <a id="greet"></a>
        <br><br>
    <h2>Variables</h2>

    Varibles are basic and used everywhere. To create a variable you simply make the name of the variable and give<br>
    it a value. You can change the value of the variable by using many of the different methods described in this page.<br>
    Example - var a = 27. In this example if you used the variable "a" it would give you the value of 27.
        <br><br>
    <h2>Arrays & Associate Arrays</h2>

    <p>
    Arrays are variables with multiple values attached in an index. An associative array uses a named index verses<br>
    calling the valuses by number. The important thing to remember when using an array is that the first value in the<br>
    array is called with a 0. So if you have an array of "var fruit = ["pear", "Pinapple", "Orange"]; Pear would be<br>
        called with a 0, and Pinapple would be called with a 1 when accessing the array.</p>
        <br><br>
    <h2>Object Creation Function</h2>

    <p>
    We know how functions work from the earlier section. You can also create objects with a function by giving the<br>
    function a property which is a list of parameters then using the "this" keyword, then populating them with variables using the "new"<br>
    keyword. You can then use those variables with the values that have been added. Lets see how this works.<br></p>
    <xmp>
    function house(where, bedroom, bathroom) {
        this.town = where;
        this.rooms = bedroom;
        this.bath = bathroom;
        }

    var beachhouse = new house("Corona", 3, 2);
    var townhouse = new house("Boise", 4, 2)
    </xmp>
    <p>
    So with this function I am creating two new objects with my variables, a beach house in Corona with 3 bedrooms and <br>
        2 bathrooms, and a townhouse in Boise, with 4 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms.</p>
        <br><br>
    <h2>Inheritance</h2>

    <p>
    Inheritance works when an object is nested within another object inheriting traits from the parent object. In our last<br>
    example we have the "where" object that tells us what city the house is in. if we want to break that down a little more<br>
        we can use the this keyword inside the where to create a further breakdown. For example.<br></p>
    <xmp>
    function house(where, bedroom, bathroom) {
        this.town = {
        city,
        state
        };
        this.rooms = bedroom;
        this.bath = bathroom;
        }
    </xmp>
    <p>
    So with this change we can now call "this.town" to call both city, and state, or if we want to break it down further we can<br>
        call just city with "this.town.city"</p>






    <!-- Put this at the bottom of your "body" tag. It will load the file "script.js" and run your javascript -->
    <script src="./scripts.js">

        var text = "";
        var i;
        for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            text += "the number is " + i + "<br>";

                    document.getElementById("counting").innerHTML = text;
                }

        function greetfunct() {
            var txt;
            var person = prompt("Who are you?");
            if (person == "Bob"){
                txt = "Hello " + person + " lets get started.";
            }
            else if (person == "Mary") {
                txt = "Hello " + person + " lets get started.";
            }
            else () {
                txt = "I don't talk to strangers"
            }
        document.getElementById("greet").innerHTML = txt;
        }
