    <h2>Loops</h2>

    Loops are handy if you need to run a piece of code over and over again. This can be used for a counting function,<br>
    or to display something like a inventory, or many other uses. The most common is the for statement.<br>
    If I were to write <xmp><code>
    var text = "";
        var i;
        for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            text += "the number is " + i + "<br>";
        }
                    document.getElementById("counting").innerHTML = text;

    </xmp></code>Then it would produce a counter like this.<br>
    <id="counting"><br>
    <br><br>
    <h2>Conditional Statements</h2>

    Conditional statements set up a list of conditions that if met will execute the command for that line. They<br>
    start with an "if", and can run through more condtions with "else if". It is good practice to finish a conditional<br>
    statement with a final "else" statement with no condtion to be met, this can output an error message or code<br>
    letting the user know that none of the condtions were met.<br>
    an example of this will be on the next section for functions.
        <br><br>
    <h2>Functions & Prameters</h2>

    A function is a block of code that performs a task when called. You will want to make a function when you want<br>
    to reuse code multiple times. You can use many different types of script in your functions to produce the results<br>
    you are looking for. The ifelse statements here would be the parameters.<br>
    So if I create this function using a conditional statement to greet users, it would look like this.<br>
    <xmp><code>
    function greetfunct() {
            var txt;
            var person = prompt("Who are you?");
            if (person == "Bob"){
                txt = "Hello " + person + " lets get started.";
            }
            else if (person == "Mary") {
                txt = "Hello " + person + " lets get started.";
            }
            else () {
                txt = "I don't talk to strangers"
            }
            document.getElementById("greet").innerHTML = txt;
        }
    </code></xmp>

    Here is the output.
    <button onclick="greetfunct()">Who are you</button>
    <a id="greet"></a>
        <br><br>
    <h2>Variables</h2>

    Varibles are basic and used everywhere. To create a variable you simply make the name of the variable and give<br>
    it a value. You can change the value of the variable by using many of the different methods described in this page.<br>
    Example - var a = 27. In this example if you used the variable "a" it would give you the value of 27.
        <br><br>
    <h2>Arrays & Associate Arrays</h2>

    Arrays are variables with multiple values attached in an index. An associative array uses a named index verses<br>
    calling the valuses by number. The important thing to remember when using an array is that the first value in the<br>
    array is called with a 0. So if you have an array of "var fruit = ["pear", "Pinapple", "Orange"]; Pear would be<br>
    called with a 0, and Pinapple would be called with a 1 when accessing the array.

            var txt;
